    question: "What's the difference between engineered wood and solid wood furniture?",
    answer:
      "Solid wood furniture is made entirely from natural wood planks, offering unique grain patterns and natural beauty that ages well over time. Engineered wood (like plywood or MDF) combines wood fibers with adhesives, creating furniture that's often more stable against humidity changes and typically more affordable. While solid wood is generally considered more premium, quality engineered wood products can be very durable and practical for many applications.",

    answer:
      "Neither leather nor fabric is universally 'better' - each has advantages. Leather is more durable, easier to clean, improves with age, and is ideal for allergy sufferers, but it's more expensive and can feel cold or hot with temperature changes. Fabric offers more color/pattern options, generally feels warmer, and is often more affordable, but may stain more easily and can trap allergens. Your choice should depend on your lifestyle, budget, aesthetic preferences, and whether you have children or pets.",

Metal frames provide modern aesthetics, strength, and often lower prices, but may create noise over time. Upholstered frames add softness and comfort but require more maintenance and cleaning. Each material has different weight capacities, assembly requirements, and style implications, so your choice should balance aesthetic preferences with practical considerations.",

Our budget-friendly lines typically use engineered woods, standard fabrics, and simplified construction while maintaining our quality standards. Premium lines offer longer warranties (5+ years vs. 3 years) and often include additional features like soft-close mechanisms or hidden storage.
